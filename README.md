## **Project Overview**
 This project aims to provide comprehensive insights and predictions for real estate properties. The module consists of several key features:

**Real Estate Price Prediction:** 
Predict the price of a property based on various features such as property type, sector, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, balconies, property age, built-up area, servant room, store room, furnishing type, luxury category, and floor category.

**Analytical Tools:** Visualize and analyze real estate data through various interactive plots and charts. This includes word clouds, scatter plots, pie charts, box plots, and distribution plots.

**Apartment Recommendation:** Recommend similar properties based on a selected apartment, taking into account various similarity measures.
Each feature is designed to help users make informed decisions when it comes to buying or investing in real estate properties.

### **Real Estate Price Prediction**
This module predicts the price of a property based on user inputs. The prediction is made using a pre-trained machine learning model. Users can input various property features to get an estimated price range.

Key features:

`Property Type`: Type of property (flat or house)

`Sector`: Location of the property

`Number of Bedrooms and Bathrooms`: Specify the number of bedrooms and bathrooms

`Balconies, Servant Room, Store Room`: Specify additional features
`Built-up Area`: Total built-up area of the property.

`Furnishing Type, Luxury Category, Floor Category`: Additional property attributes
The model provides an estimated price range based on the input features.

### **Real Estate Analytical Tools**
This section provides various tools to analyze and visualize real estate data. Users can explore different sectors, property types, and other features through interactive plots and charts.

Key tools:

`Price and Built-up Area Map`: A Mapbox scatter plot showing the relationship between price, built-up area, and location.

`Word Cloud`: Visualize key features of properties in different sectors.

`Area vs Price Scatter Plot`: Explore the relationship between built-up area and price.
`Distribution of Bedrooms`: Pie charts showing the distribution of properties by the number of bedrooms.

`Price Range for Different BHKs`: Box plots showing price ranges for different BHK configurations.

`Price Distribution`: Distribution plots for property prices based on property type (house or flat).
These tools help users gain deeper insights into the real estate market.

### **Apartment Recommendation**
This module recommends similar properties based on a selected apartment. Users can specify a location and radius to search for nearby properties. Based on the selected property, the module recommends other properties with similar characteristics.

Key features:

`Location and Radius`: Select a location and specify a radius to search for nearby properties.

`Property Selection`: Choose a property from the search results to get recommendations.

`Similarity Scores`: Properties are recommended based on similarity scores calculated using various similarity measures.
This feature helps users find properties that match their preferences.
